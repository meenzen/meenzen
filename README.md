:wave: Hi, I am a software developer from Germany. In my free time I like building silly software projects.

Somtimes I think _"Theres probably a good library for this"_ and it turns out there isn't. Just some random `.NET Framework 4.5` project that's been abandoned seven years ago. A few moments later:

1. I start building a library.
2. Let's make it open source, It'll probably be useful to someone.
3. Profit? - No. Now someone might actually start using it and expect it to be maintained.
4. I stop maintaining it.

If you're finding any of my open source projects helpful and are interested in continued maintenance, feel free to [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/meenzen).

**Note:** I don't _need_ any sponsorships, **my projects are free to use and will always stay that way**. That being said, having somone give me money, even a very small amount, makes me feel obligated to keep working on these projects.

Things I love in no particular order:

- Linux
- NixOS
- Docker
- JetBrains IDEs
- .NET / C# / F#
- Blazor
- [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=h8KdwKTGLReP) (referral link, 20€ free cloud credit)

Things I don't like:

- JavaScript, because `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined`
- Visual Studio
